A: INTRODUCTION (INTRODUCING THE “SMART PURIFIER”)
A1: We came up with this idea of a “SMART purifier” because of the developing haze in recent months especially in Kuala Lumpur.
Haze is caused by forest and open burnings like in Indonesia.
A “SMART purifier” like ours is useful for air pollution like this. 
What is air pollution? Wherever there is coal burning or palm oil plantation there WILL be pollution.


B: BODY (THE “SMART PURIFIER”)
B1: this is the SMART purifier.
The “SMART purifier” is so smart that it is automatic. It only turns on when you really need it.
B2: The benefits of the “SMART purifier”.
The “SMART purifier” will actually save electricity because it only turn on when you need it like I mentioned just now, and because it saves electricity it saves money.
Last but not least is that it sorta saves YOU. If you are really busy to turn on and off whatever purifier you should replace that with this “SMART purifier” as it decreases your chance of death or sickness because of haze, as I said, “SMART purifier” will save you and it does that by automating everything so you don’t even have to move.
B3: This is how the”SMART purifier” works.
It works like so. If the dust/haze sensor detects the dust density level to 100 and up it will turn on the fan/filter.
B4:  Now I’m going to explain how each and every component works.
The components I used is Jumper cables, a breadboard, arduino UNO, SHARP dust sensor (the dust/haze sensor), 220 uF capacitor 150Ω resister, 12V computer fan, power adapter, computer, USB cable, crocodile clips (banana wires) and finally the MOSFET.
Now I will go with explaining every single component.
A resistor resists the electricity from a circuit so you won’t burn an LED you are trying to turn on. A capacitor is a component that is used to store electricity before giving it out. A jumper cable is a cable used to pass electricity. The breadboard is used to run electricity easily through a circuit. The SHARP dust sensor is the dust/haze sensor, the computer fan is the filter, The MOSFET is a special type of resistor that is a little bit like a valve, the one where there is a gate, source and drain. A MOSFET is like that.
B5: I have faced off many challenges while making this project so here are a couple of the lot.
One of them is when we bought a MOSFET, later I will explain more about the MOSFET. So like I was saying the MOSFET that we bought was way to big for my breadboard to be fitted in. I even tried to force but I knew that forcing only made it worse.
The other problems I stumbled across is when my   
my code kept getting syntax errors I researched about my errors and turns out I didn’t even install the library I needed properly.
 it saves electricity because it turns on only when you need it like I said just now it’s automated. So when it saves electricity it saves money as well.


CONCLUSION:
C1: Now I’m going to tell you what I might do in the near future for this product.

One of the things I will do in the future might be to add an LCD screen to display the dust density.
The other is I might connect this with an online app or website.
